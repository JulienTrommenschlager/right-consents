More than the previous pages explaining how to create all kinds of models and how to combine them to create consent forms, the operator also has the possibility to search a specific user via the search bar. 

With this search bar, an operator can search a given user by his user id, so that he can have a complete overview on a given user (the date when this user profile was activated, which processings this user has accepted, which one he rejected, which one he was never presented to, and the same for the preferences and the terms of use). Moreover, this functionnality is particularly usefull for the operator in case of call centers for example (a user calls directly the helpdesk of your company wanting his consent modified, you can do it for him and send him a proof afterwards stating the modification done!)

If the user does not exist, it will create him in your user base as soon as you modify something on his page. 

If the user already exists, the date from when he has been created will appear.
