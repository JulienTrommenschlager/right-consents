## Operator interface

More than the previous pages explaining how to create all kinds of models and how to combine them to create consent forms, the operator also has the possibility to **search for a specific user** via the search bar. 

### Why this functionality ?

With this search bar, an operator can search a given user by his user id, so that he can have **a complete overview on a given user** (the date when this user profile was activated, which processings this user has accepted, which one he rejected, which one was never submitted to him, and the same for the preferences and the terms of use). Moreover, this functionnality is particularly usefull for the operator in case of call centers for example (a user calls directly the helpdesk of your company wanting his consent modified, you can do it for him and send him a proof afterwards stating the modification done!)

### How does it work ?

{% include gallery %} 

If the user does not exist, it will create him in your user base as soon as you modify something on his page. 
On the contrary, if the user already exists, the date from when he has been created will appear. 

Once again, the principle guiding this search functionnality is to give the operator an overview on a specific user and to **be able to make changes on his behalf on any kind of elements** (processings, preferences).

Each time a change is made by the operator on the user page, it is logged into the **modification bar** on the right, pending for the operator's validation. As long as the modifications are not confirmed by the operator, it does not change anything for the end-user. Once every change needed is made, the operator can confirm his changes and then it can add additional information such as a general comment, the **possibility to email the end-user** with the new receipt for the changes made....
