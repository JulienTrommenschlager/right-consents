## User access

As a first step to the Customer Privacy Portal (as described by Gartner in different reports), we have imagined a dedicated interface for the end-users to be able to access their choices regarding the organization's processings and preferences and to be able to modify their choices at any time. 

(% include gallery %)

### Is it mandatory ? 

The access to this dedicated page is, of course, totally configurable for the organization: you can choose to give your users access to this page or not, to choose what they can and cannot see on this page....
