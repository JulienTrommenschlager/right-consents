## User access

To deliver the best experience to the end-users (through even more transparency and control over their data), a dedicated interface can be made available to the end-users to access their choices regarding the organization's processings and preferences and to be able to modify their choices at any time.

### Is it mandatory ? 

The access to this dedicated page is, of course, totally configurable for the organization: you can choose to give your users access to this page or not, to choose what they can and cannot see on this page....
