fair[&]smart Right Consents community edition is an Open Source European Universal Consents & Preferences Management Plateform. It aims to provide a complete **open source** and **free to use** solution for **collecting**, **operating**, **preserving** and **analysing** all aspects of consent's management and user's preferences in an organisation.

## **Notable features**

The solution comes with a **full featured backoffice** that allows to define models for many kinds of user's based choices (processings, preferences, terms of service, privacy policy).

**Defined models** but also general information (privacy policy, PII controller, ...) can be used in various collecting schemes including a **specific operator interface** that allows to setup user preferences and consents in a way that **complies with GDPR**.

Right Consents platform **ensure records** of preferences, consents and terms of use but also **receipts generation** with **certified timestamp** and/or **signature** in order to build a fully operational consent base and a **long term preservation** receipts base compliant with rgpd recommendations.

End-users have also access to an optional **user dedicated page** that allows them to update consents and preferences provided by the organisation. User page access links can be given in multiple ways but are, at least, included in the consent receipt for the whole consent validity duration.

Consent receipts are available in **multiple formats** (xml, pdf, html or simple text). That receipt allows users to **keep track** of a given consent but also to **forward or transfer** that consent to any other party or also to modify or withdraw consent or preferences within the included long time preserved update link.

All operations are exposed in a fully documented and **dedicated REST API**. Many security components and user **privacy enforcement's technologies** are included or optional such as certified timestamp for **non repudiation** of a given consent or specific **end-to-end ciphering**. Those aspects ensure the best level of **data privacy** and lifecycle tracking management for models combined with hash strategy ensuring a **strong secured approach** to data storage.

Finally, a fully supported enterprise version is available and **hosted by Fair&Smart**. This enterprise version provides specific functionalities adapted to business and **highly available** capabilities. For any kind of specific needs, enterprise version benefits of a premium support allowing specific improvements.
